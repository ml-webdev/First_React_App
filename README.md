 Mod 2 Project
My goal was to create a three-component application using React JS. I decided to create an app to help develop mindfulness. This app is called "Myndful" and it contains a component for rendering random quotes via an API, a timer component for breathing exercises, and a sound player component for ambient noise. Skills utilized for this app: async/await for the quotes, React Hooks for the Timer, and Howler for the sound player.
